## New Features:
Welcome to MIST 1.1.0 so ik what you're thinking "what makes her different from Mist 1.0.0"
1. MIST 1.1.0 is fully interactive which means she won't just be a clunky file that only runs on startup but she'll implement herself into .basrc file so you can run all of her features without having her take up the screen completely
2. Unlike how MIST 1.0.0 has shitty code and really isn't customizable MIST 1.1.0 is fully customizable so you wont have to worry about messing up any of her code.
3. Unlike MIST 1.0.0 MIST 1.1.0 doesn't fall apart if you modify one file because unlike MIST 1.0.0 MIST 1.1.0 has all of her files seperate (except the game files) so don't worry about messing anything up lol
4. MIST 1.1.0 has a built in mp3 player. the code is still being worked on so the randomize function is a bit clunky rn but more updates will come in the future lol.

## Commands:
you can find all of the commands in the `help.txt` file or you can just type in ``help_me`` into the terminal

## Future of MIST
Mist will slowly improve and get better the more better i get at c++
im planning to impliment her with some more features like: 
* A password manager
* A web scrapper
* A password cracker
and etc but for now tell me how you think the beta is.
