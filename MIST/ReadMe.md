## New Features:
Welcome to MIST 1.3.0 so ik what you're thinking "what makes her different from Mist 1.2.0 and why did you skip mist 1.2.0"
***
Well because 1.2.0 was basically jist the first half of 1.3.0... now that that is answered let's get to the features
***
#### Whats new?
***
* 4 new commands
* some commands got changed in order to make room for the new commands, out was for shutting down but we i changed it to end in order to make room for the new logout feature (xfce logout exclusevly but you an change the file to whatever version of linux you use)
* you can now boot into the terminal only or the gui
* MIST 1.3.0 no longer fucks up your ``.bashrc`` file now all the commands are held in the ``.bash_aliases`` file
* I added 20 new responses to the chat to mist file so now she has a bit more dialogue
* I removed the PANTHEON sci fi adventure game because that will be an entierly seperate project from MIST and it was already way too big for the games so instead i updated the slot machine game and added a tic tac toe game instead.

## Commands:
you can find all of the commands in the `help.txt` file or you can just type in ``help_me`` into the terminal

## Future of MIST
Mist will slowly improve and get better the more better i get at c++
im planning to impliment her with some more features like: 
* A password manager
* A web scrapper
* A password cracker
and etc but for now tell me how you think the beta is.
