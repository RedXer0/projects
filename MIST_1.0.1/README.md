Mist is a personal terminal assistant with some flaws, I'll be updating her as time goes on but for rn she's pretty bare bones.

currently the jokes.txt and punchlines.txt files are in the beta stage, you can add all your own jokes and stuff but just remember that they're still being updated.

the games.cpp file is the oldest of the files besides from mist so the code is kinda shitty because i was still trying to get a grasp of c++.

currently the joke files wont print properly without the underscores but im working on a solution rn.

if you want the assistant to run in your terminal on startup simply put it into the 
.bashrc file.
/path/to/mist 
(don't put in mist.cpp put in the executable).

If you wanna change some things you can as long as yk what you're doing, you can also use mist as a sort of base for your own terminal assistant.

alright have fun with mist.

(more features might be added but for now it'll mostly just be optomization tweaks.)
